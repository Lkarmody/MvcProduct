# MvcProduct
Week 5 Assignment - update - 
Added SimpleViewModel.cs, ViewData/SimpleMemory.cs, SimpleContorller.cs, View/SimpleItem/Create, View/SimpleItem/Edit, View/SimpleItem/Display and Infrastrucutre/SettingsManager.cs to create xml file
ViewModel has requirements for all user inputs and has client side validation
Used the example from the documention to build the settingsmanager class and added the load and save methods to program.cs 
Logger is added to the SimpleController but could not seem to find the statements in the debugger when I would run the code, although the code was tested and works as intended.
