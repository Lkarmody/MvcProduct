# MvcProduct
Week 4 Assignment - update - 
Added CarsContoller, Cars Model, Cars View and CarsContext DB
Bootstrap works due to scafolding, window resizes and operates. 
Used Select form and radio buttons as new input methods for the CarsController.
Added my name "Lissette Karmody" as a partial view in the footer by creating a _UserName.cshtml file and then referencing it in the _Layout.cshtml file.
Tested project with tab usage only and logic is sound on all pages.
